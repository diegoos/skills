# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `code-review-plus`: optional stack shapes for web, API, TypeScript/JavaScript/Node, Python, Go, Rust, and `llm` (`references/shapes/`).
- `code-review-plus`: adaptive dispatch tiers (`trivial` | `normal` | `large/sensitive`) in Phase 1 scope.
- `code-review-plus`: shapes on tier `normal` when exactly one eligible stack tag applies; multi-tag on `normal` omits shapes.
- `code-review-plus`: optional single P0 verifier subagent after Pass B (ambiguity or ≥2 P0-capable candidates); skip documented when Pass B suffices.
- `code-review-plus`: orchestrator-only `dependency-review.md`, structural `remedies.md`, Pass B examples `examples/kept-vs-dropped.md` (stack FP/TP cases), and optional `examples/eval-notes.md` calibration pattern.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog) and an `AGENTS.md` rule to record notable changes here on every edit.

### Changed

- `global-rules.md`: _tight_ ladder (build-or-not → reuse → stdlib → platform → dep → one-line → min); edge-case-correct at equal size; `ceiling:`/`upgrade:` marker; surgical fix-once / wrong-place warning; challenge X-vs-Y; a11y and data-loss-safe errors; _red_ proof allows assert/self-check; durable still wins for structure; stack and done checklist unchanged.
- Root `README.md`: operating stack for agent rules (global → repo `AGENTS.md` → skills); layered or fused deploy.
- `code-review-plus`: thinner `SKILL.md` (READ + completion criteria per phase); denser perspectives, verify, synthesize, fix, and report template.
- `code-review-plus`: hunter reference budget (`1` perspective + `0|1` shape); Pass A canonicalized in the dispatch prompt; pipeline/shape Pass A limited to domain-specific reminders.
- `code-review-plus`: English-only tier label `large/sensitive` (replaces Portuguese `grande/sensível`).
- `code-review-plus`: prose cleanup for agent docs (less duplication, clearer regression-gate wording, single pointer to `/deep-security-review`).
- Root `README.md`: clearer `global-rules.md`, link to `CHANGELOG.md`, root layout, tighter skill blurbs, `/code-review-plus fix`, and `llm` / normal-tier shape notes.

### Fixed

- `code-review-plus`: false-positive table covers configured formatter/linter style ownership; harder P0 bar and `needs-runtime` handling in verify/synthesize.
