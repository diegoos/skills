## Available skills

| Skill                                                      | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`write-great-agentsmd`](skills/write-great-agentsmd/)** | Creates, updates, and audits `AGENTS.md` — the policy that orchestrates the agent in the repo. Branches: **bootstrap** (from scratch), **update** (sync after changes), **lint** (health audit).                       |
| **[`commit-message`](skills/commit-message/)**             | Generates [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) messages from the real diff. Fires only when asked; never force-pushes, skips hooks, or commits secrets.                                        |
| **[`code-review-plus`](skills/code-review-plus/)**         | Code review across 5 dimensions (correctness, security, architecture, quality, performance) with parallel subagents and anti-false-positive checks. Prioritized report (P0–P3), calibrated to avoid inflated severity. |
| **[`make-docs`](skills/make-docs/)**                       | Generates and maintains architecture docs and behavioral specs in `docs/`. Branches: **explore** (survey → propose → generate), **update** (commits since the `Updated on` stamp), **adr** (decision record).          |
| **[`sass-with-bem`](skills/sass-with-bem/)**               | Writes and reviews BEM CSS with Sass/SCSS — flat selectors via `&` nesting, block/element/modifier, `is-`/`has-` states, 7-1 partials. Branches: **write**, **review**.                                                |

> Each skill has a `SKILL.md` (source of truth for the agent).
>
> Some include a human-facing `README.md`, catalogues (`PATTERNS.md`), or
> templates under `references/`.

## Quickstart

1. Install via the [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/) script:
   - All skills:

   ```bash
   npx skills add diegoos/skills
   ```

   - A specific skill:

   ```bash
   # e.g. install the write-great-agentsmd skill
   npx skills add diegoos/skills --skill write-great-agentsmd
   ```

2. Done — you can use the installed skill(s).

## Custom OpenCode agents

Custom agents for OpenCode can live under `.opencode/agents/`.

> They are not part of the skills contract.

| Agent          | Role                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ask`**      | Read-only persona: conversation and code analysis. No edits, no bash, no subagents.                            |
| **`reviewer`** | Single-pass, high-signal review persona. Complements `code-review-plus` (which does the deep parallel review). |

## How to use

In some cases the agent loads the skill from intent — you don't need to name it:

```text
"Create an AGENTS.md for this project"           → write-great-agentsmd (bootstrap)
"Generate docs for this codebase"                → make-docs (explore)
"Update the docs after these changes"            → make-docs (update)
"Record the decision to use Postgres"            → make-docs (adr)
"Add a BEM card component in SCSS"               → sass-with-bem (write)
"Review these styles for BEM compliance"         → sass-with-bem (review)
```

Or invoke by skill name/command (e.g. `/make-docs explore`), depending on the
harness.
